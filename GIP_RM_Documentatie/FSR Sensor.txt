Calculation example
The output voltage (Vout) that we measure with the Arduino is described by the following equation:

Vout = Vcc x R / (R + Rfsr)

So the voltage is inversely proportional to the FSR resistance. Note that the output voltage you measure is the voltage drop across the pull-down resistor, not across the FSR.

When no force is applied, the FSR resistance will be really high, take 10 MΩ as an example. I used a 10 kΩ pull-down resistor and a Vcc of 5 V for this tutorial, which results in the following output when no force is applied:

Vout = 5 V x 10 kΩ/ (10 kΩ + 10 MΩ) = 0.005 V

So almost 0 V. If you press really hard on the FSR, the resistance will go down to roughly 200 Ω. This results in the following output voltage:

Vout = 5 V x 10 kΩ/ (10 kΩ + 200 Ω) = 4.9 V

As you can see, you should be able to measure an output voltage between 0 and 4.9V depending on the amount of force you apply to the sensor.

FSR Specifications
The technology used in FSRs is patented by Interlink Electronics which has been in operation since 1985. The most common types of FSR that you will find are the Interlink FSR 402 and 406.

This are the specifications of the round 402 sensor that I used in this tutorial.
